# 👋 Hi, I'm Kyrsten — Full Stack Engineer with a Mission-Driven Mindset

I'm a senior software engineer passionate about building impactful products that make people’s lives better — whether that’s through mobile-first experiences, intuitive web interfaces, or resilient backend systems.

Currently, I lead engineering efforts at [Launchpoint Dev](https://launchpoint.dev), where I’ve had the opportunity to architect and ship features used by millions — from biometric authentication across mobile apps to high-performance APIs powering $50M+ in annual transactions.

## ✨ A Bit More About Me

After being diagnosed with **Hashimoto’s**, I became obsessed with understanding how to better support my health through nutrition, movement, and mindfulness. That journey led me deep into the world of food-as-medicine — and ultimately sparked a passion for building tools that empower others to take control of their well-being.

Outside of work, I’m deeply into **health and fitness**, a loyal devotee of **strong coffee**, and an avid **reader** of everything from software design patterns to behavioral psychology. Whether I’m refining a user flow or deadlifting between commits, I bring the same curiosity and commitment to growth.

I thrive in early-stage, fast-paced environments where ideas turn into impact. I love solving complex technical challenges, especially when the end result helps people live better lives.
