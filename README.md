### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kyrsten Carlson!

I'm curious and coninuously learning new ways to make things better!

I love working on Front End projects and making things pretty but I have full stack capabilities.


## About Me

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for a health and fitness start up to make people stronger! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning WidgetKit and how to incorporate iOS widgets and complications with mobile apps.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that make people the best versions of themselves. I am passionate about personal growth and want to help anyone get farther in their journey,
